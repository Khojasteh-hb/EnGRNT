# EnGRNT
This code is related to our recently proposed method called EnGRNT. EnGRNT is a supervised learning method that uses the gene expression data and topological features extracted from GRN to train ensemble classifiers and ultimately improves the GRN structure. 

# Requirement:
This program is suitable for R Version 1.1.453 and above versions. The program has adopted by on simulated data and stable state of Escherichia coli (E. coli) . By some little change it can be used for any input data.

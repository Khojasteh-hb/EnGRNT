# EnGRNT
This code is related to our recently proposed method called EnGRNT. EnGRNT is a supervised learning method that uses the gene expression data and topological features extracted from GRN to train ensemble classifiers and ultimately improves the GRN structure. 

# Requirement:

This program is suitable for R Version 1.1.453 and above versions. The program has adopted by on simulated data and stable state of Escherichia coli (E. coli) . By some little change it can be used for any input data.

# The details of the used dataset can be accessible in the below paper:
Gillani, Z., Akash, M. S. H., Rahaman, M. M., & Chen, M. (mchen@zju.edu.cn) (2014). CompareSVM: supervised, Support Vector Machine (SVM) inference of gene regularity networks. BMC bioinformatics, 15(1), 395.
